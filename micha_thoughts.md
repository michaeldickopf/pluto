## Questions:

- What functionality is needed ?
  - only want to store the entered emails ?
  - or maybe send a confirmation email -> smtp server needed
  - Shop system (maybe with pre-order ability or the ability to concern interest in a certain product


Idea:

  - Maybe for the first version, only a static display (free on Cloudflare/ Github pages), where you market your product

  - Similary, we build a backend for a shop system, newsletter, etc.

- Then we link the shop website to the main page ?


What exactly should be the content of the website ? 
What am I supposed to do ?
